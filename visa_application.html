        </h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px">
          If you plan to go to Australia for study, travel, or work, OSHC and
          OVHC is a must thing to ensure because that’s how it works. You can’t
          skip overseas student health coverage if you are an international
          student in Australia. Moves International will help you connect to
          some of the best insurance companies to secure you. It is not expected

        <p>
          OSHC is a must for student visas to stay in Australia. Those who are
          about to continue their study there must have OSHC, and the same
          applies to visitors or tourists. That is called overseas visitors’
          health cover or OVHC.
        </p>

        <p>
          For anyone who comes to Australia to visit or for travel purposes,
          OVHC is a must for them. It says that you need appropriate health
          insurance before getting into Australia for your safety. Health
          insurance will allow you to take medical services throughout your stay
          in this country. Connect with us to get OVHC from one of the best
          health insurance agencies.
        </p>

        <h3>The following visa categories cover OVHC.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Visitors visas (Subclass 300, 580, 590, 600, 601)/li></li>
          <li>Working holiday visas (subclass 417 and 562)</li>
          <li>Bridging visas</li>
          <li>Working visas (Subclass 401, 401, 476, 482, 485, 489)</li>
        </ul>

          If you have recently completed your graduate program and applied for a
          temporary visa which is subclass 485, we can help you switch from OSHC
